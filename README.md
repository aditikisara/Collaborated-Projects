Here is all of the information on the projects I have collaborated on and are not in my profile.

Community Shelter and Food Pantry Logger

For our Database Systems project, my colleague and I created a webapp filled with resources for people in underserved communities. We gathered data from Google and created our own database from scratch. Our app consists of six services: food pantries, clothing banks, soup kitchens, medical assistance services, daycare services, and homeless shelters. Each of those services has the following information stored. Users have the ability to find services based on its city, county and zip code, the managers at each service, and the customers that are subscribed to each service.

We didn't want regular users to be able to make major changes to our database, so we created the role of "admin". The purpose of the admin is to edit/delete managers or users. That way, changes made to the database are secure. Currently the only admins are my colleague and me.
